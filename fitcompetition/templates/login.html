            <h2>Welcome to Fit Competition!</h2>
            <p>Maybe you're fit, maybe you're trying to get fit.  Either way, Fit Competition is fun for everybody.</p>
            <p>It's simple.  Join a challenge to complete a certain number of miles within a specific time frame.  Put the required ante in the pot, and if you complete the challenge, you share a peice of the pot with everyone else who completed the challenge!</p>
            <p>If everyone completes the challenge, everyone gets thier money back!  But if you are one of only a few to complete the challenge, get ready for some bling!  What have you got to lose?</p>
